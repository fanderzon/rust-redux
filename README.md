# rust-redux
An attempt to implement Redux for Rust at the React Europe hackathon.

## Why
No matter what language you are writing the structured way redux handles state is still a very useful pattern.

## Current state of the project
This is a demo and nothing else at this point. `src/redux.rs` has the barebones Redux implementation and `src/main.rs` uses redux to handle the state of a todo app (what else).
